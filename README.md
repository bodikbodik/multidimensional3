# Multidimensional arrays 3

## Task 1
Two-dimensional array consists of integer elements. Find the arithmetic **_average_** of elements less than the value of **_a_**.
```
Example 
        array: { { 4, 10, 5 },
                 { 3, 2, 35 },
                 { 30, 55, 66 } };
               a = 5;

        average = 3;
```

## Task 2
Two-dimensional array consists of integer elements. Calculate the **_amount_** of negative elements below the main diagonal.
```
Example 
        array: { { 15, 60, 65 },
                 { -5, 14, 53 },
                 { -1, -10 ,59 } }

        amount = 3
```

## Task 3
Two-dimensional array consists of integer elements. Write the product of the elements of each line, greater than the arithmetic mean of the elements of the line into the new array **_minarray_**.
```
Example 
        array: { { 2, 0, 7 },
                 { 13, 15, 31 },
                 { 10, 5 ,0 } }
                 
        minarray = { 7, 31, 10 }
```
